                <p>This introductory documentation Raspian Operating System for Raspberry Pi.<br>Raspbian is the recommended operating system for Raspberry Pi (being optimized for its hardware) and is based on a GNU/Linux distribution Debian.</p>
                <p>Raspbian was created by Mike Thompson and Peter Green as an independent project1. The initial launch was in June 2012. The operating system is still in active development. Raspbian is highly optimized for the Raspberry Pi.</p>

              <article>
                <p>Raspbian is an unofficial port of Debian (GNU/Linux) wheezy armhf with compilation settings adjusted to produce code that uses "hardware floating point", the "hard float" ABI and will run on the Raspberry Pi.<br>The port is necessary because the official Debian wheezy armhf release is compatible only with versions of the ARM architecture later than the one used on the Raspberry Pi (ARMv7-A CPUs and higher, vs the Raspberry Pi's ARMv6 CPU).</p>
                <p> The Debian squeeze image issued by the Raspberry Pi foundation was based on debian armel which uses software floating point and the "soft float" ABI. The foundation used the existing Debian port for less capable ARM devices. Therefore, it did not use of the Pi's processor's floating point hardware - reducing the Pi's performance during floating point intensive applications - or the advanced instructions of the ARMv6 CPUs </p>

                  <p>The goal of Raspbian is to become the leading OS of choice for all users of the Raspberry Pi.<br> Raspbian images are produced by various people. For newcomers we recommend the images provided by the Raspberry Pi foundation available in their download page.</p>
                  <p>Raspbian tries to stay as close to Debian as reasonably possible. Any information you find that applies to Debian will almost certainly apply to the same version of Raspbian. Information for earlier versions of debian will often apply too but may need some tweaks just as it would when using it on a newer version of debian.</p>

              <article>
                <p>To install Raspbian on our Raspberry Pi we have two versions; one more complete with graphical environment and a smaller without graphical environment:</p>
                  <ul><li>Raspbian Pixel:<p>Pi Improved X-Window Environment, Lightweigh is the full version with Raspbian graphical environment, i.e. the desktop version with menus, windows, icons, wallpapers, etc. used by most users as a desktop computer.</p></li>
                      <li>Raspbian Lite:<p>Version without graphical environment, i.e. the console mode version without graphs. This option is generally for advanced users with knowledge of Linux who use the Raspberry Pi as a server.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In order to install the Raspbian operating system, we must first access the downloads section from The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/"> Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> website and choose from two options for installation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Via NOOBS</li>
                    <li>Through an OS image</li>
                </ul>

                <article>
                  <p>NOOBS or "New Out Of Box Software" is a simple step-by-step guided installer, this option includes a quick edit method of configuring the new system, a pre-installed web browser and a command line recovery mode from a rescue partition that is automatically created.</p>
                  <p>You can choose between <br> - NOOBS Pixel: Full version with graphical environment (windows, folders, etc ; uses about 2G of space).
                  <br>- NOOBS Lite: Reduced version without graphic environment (console mode, uses about 32Mb of space).</p>

                <article>
                  <p>Before installing Raspbian we have to format the SD card with FAT32 format. To do this we can download the free SDCard software, or format it using the command line.</p>
                  <code>diskutil list</code><code>sudo diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 SDCARD MBRFormat /dev/disk2</code>
                  <p> Next we  copy the downloaded NOOBS files inside the card.</p>
                  <p>Last connect your Raspberry Pi and select the options offered by the installation wizard.<br> The installation process takes about 15-20 minutes.</p>

                <header>Download Raspbian Image</header>
                <article>
                  <p>An image is a file containing the structure and complete contents of an operating system.<br>This is useful when we want all our computers to have the same configuration.<br> We can create a default image and save it as a backup, saving the time when we need to re-install and configure our Raspberry Pi.</p>
                  <p>The Raspbian with Desktop image contained in the ZIP archive is over 4GB in size, these archives use features not supported by older unzip tools on some platforms. We recommend using 7Zip (Windows) or The Unarchiver (Macintosh). Both are free and have been tested to unzip the image correctly.</p>
                  <h3>You can Choose between this official Versions on The Raspberry Pi Site</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Raspbian Buster with desktop and recommended software</li>
                    <li>Raspbian Buster with desktop</li>
                    <li>Raspbian Buster Lite</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are no huge differences between Debian Stretch and Debian Buster, most of the differences are security changes designed to make Buster harder to hack. If you want to install previous versions of Raspian (like Jessie or Stretch) you can visit <a href="https://www.raspbian.org/">This Site</a></p>
                <p>Once we donwload our Image Version, we have to pass the content of the Raspbian image to our microSD. For this we can download the free <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Etcher</a> software, or add the operating system image using the command line. This process usually takes about 20 minutes.</p>
                <note>Note: the use of the dd tool can overwrite any partition of your machine. If you specify the wrong device in the instructions below, you could delete your primary Mac OS partition. Please be careful.</note>
                <p>Open a terminal and run:</p>
                <code>diskutil list</code>
                <p>Identify the disk (not the partition) of your SD card,</p>
                <p>Unmount your SD card by using the disk identifier, to prepare it for copying data<br> Where "disk" is your BSD name e.g</p>
                <code>diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk<disk# from diskutil></code>
                <p>Copy the data to your SD card:</p>
                <code>sudo dd bs=1m if=image.img of=/dev/rdisk<disk# from diskutil> conv=sync</code>
                <p>This may result in a dd: "invalid number '1m' error" if you have GNU coreutils installed. In that case, you need to use a block size of 1M in the bs= section, as follows:</p>
                <code>sudo dd bs=1M if=image.img of=/dev/rdisk<disk# from diskutil> conv=sync</code>
                <p>If this command still fails, try using disk instead of rdisk, for example:</p>
                <code>sudo dd bs=1M if=2019-07-10-raspbian-buster.img of=/dev/disk4 conv=sync</code>
                <p>Eject the card:</p>
                <code>sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdisk<disk# from diskutil></disk></code>
                <p>Finally, we will connect our Raspberry Pi to prove that Raspbian has been installed correctly.</p>

                    <article>
                      <p>Once we have installed Raspbian on our Raspberry Pi, either by following the NOOBS wizard or by installing an image, it is convenient to update.<br> To do this, access the terminal and execute the following commands:</p>
                      <code>pi@raspberrypi: ~ $ sudo apt-get update</code>
                      <p>With this command, we are updating the repositories</p>
                      <code>pi@raspberrypi: ~ $ sudo apt-get upgrade</code>
                      <p>With this command we do an update of our operating system and the applications that are contained in the repositories.</p>
                      <code>Meow Meeeow *SCREECH* *HISSSSS*<br/>Ich bin ein Katzenliebhaber</code>
                      <p> We will copy the downloaded NOOBS files inside the card.</p>
